\section{Finding the 3,1 partition}\label{sec:3,1-partition}

As seen on the BrandstÃ¤dt's algorithm every vertex of a 2,1 partition must at least be compliance to one of the neighborhood rules:

\begin{itemize}
  \item (N1) $N(v)$ induces a split graph.
  \item (N2) Or, $\bar{N}(v)$ should induce a bipartite graph.
\end{itemize}

If every vertex match exactly one of these rules, then the Graph is known to be a 2,1 Graph.
On the other hand if any vertex does not match N1 or N2 then the Graph is bound to not have a 2,1 partition.
However, when a vertex matches both N1 and N2 the graph could have a 2,1 partition but clearly has a 3,1 partition as the union of the induced split of it's open neighborhood, and the bipartite induced by its complement describe such partition.

Therefore, the following algorithm can be declared.
\begin{code}{Get 2-1-Partition}
def Get_21(Graph G) 2-1-Partition
  cl = new Graph #intended clique
  bi = new Graph #intended bipartite 
  for v in V(G) do # O(n)
      N = |$N(v)$| # open neighborhood of v
      K = |$\bar{N}(v)$| # V(G) - N
      if N.is_Split() then # O(m)
        bi.Add(v)
      if K.is_Bipartite() then # O(m)
        cl.Add(v)
      if (!bi.contains(v) and !cl.contains(v)) then
       return None; # G $\notin$ (2,1)
  end # O(n*m)
  if |$cl.V \cap bi.V = \emptyset$| then
    if (!cl.is_Clique() or !bi._is_Bipatite()) then
      return None; # G $\notin$ (2,1)
    else return new 2-1-patition{
      |$C$|: cl
      |$I_1$|: bi.|$I_1$|,
      |$I_2$|: bi.|$I_2$|
    }
  else 
    using any |$v \in cl.V \cap bi.V$|
    N = |$N(v)$| # open neighborhood of v
    K = |$\bar{N}(v)$| # V(G) - N
    tr = new 3-1-Partition{
          |$C$|: N.Clique,
          |$I_1$|: N.Independent,
          |$I_2$|: K.|$I_1$|,
          |$I_3$|: K.|$I_2$|,
    }
    return 3-1-to-2-1(tr)
  end
end
\end{code}

\section{Odd Cycle transversal}\label{sec:oct}

The Odd Cycle transversal can be described as the problem of finding a subset of vertices of a graph such that when removed from said graph makes it a bipartite graph.
This problem is known to be NP-Complete, however, Reed, Smith and Vetta presented a fixed-parameter tractable algorithm for this problem.
Such algorithm obtain the desirable subset running in time $3^kn^{\mathcal{O}(1)}$ \cite{reed-04}

Is imperative we further analyze this algorithm, as it's strategy will be relevant for our next steps.
