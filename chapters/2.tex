\section{Finding the 3,1 partition}\label{sec:3,1-partition}

As seen on the BrandstÃ¤dt's algorithm every vertex of a 2,1 partition must at least be compliance to one of the neighborhood rules:

\begin{itemize}
    \item (N1) $N(v)$ induces a split graph.
    \item (N2) Or, $\bar{N}(v)$ should induce a bipartite graph.
\end{itemize}

If every vertex match exactly one of these rules, then the Graph is known to be a 2,1 Graph.
On the other hand if any vertex does not match N1 or N2 then the Graph is bound to not have a 2,1 partition.
However, when a vertex matches both N1 and N2 the graph could have a 2,1 partition but clearly has a 3,1 partition as the union of the induced split of it's open neighborhood, and the bipartite induced by its complement describe such partition.

Therefore, the following algorithm can be declared.

\section{Odd Cycle transversal}\label{sec:oct}

The Odd Cycle transversal can be described as the problem of finding a subset of vertices of a graph such that when removed from said graph makes it a bipartite graph.
This problem is known to be NP-Complete, however, Reed, Smith and Vetta presented a fixed-parameter tractable algorithm for this problem.
Such algorithm obtains the desirable subset running in time $3^{k}n^{\mathcal{O}(1)}$ \cite{reed-04}

Is imperative we further analyze this algorithm, as it's strategy will be relevant for our next steps.

\subsection{The iterative compression technique}\label{subsec:the-iterative-compression-technique}

The solution developed in~\cite{reed-04} is the base for the now called Iterative Compression technique;
A compression can be described as following:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Assume there is a non-optimal solution $S$ of size $k+1$ for the problem $A$
    \item Using the given solution as input find a solution for the Disjoint-$A$ problem, i.e. find a smaller solution $X$ of size $k$ in $G-P_S$ where $P_S$ is every subset of $S$ of size $ \leq |S| - |X|$.
\end{itemize}


It's trivial to notice that this steps can be applied as many times as needed to reduce the non-optimal solution to the desired size solution,
or to declare that such solution does not exist, therefore the iterative part of the technique name.
Some solutions for the problems \emph{Vertex Cover, Feedback Vertex Set, Feedback Vertex Set in Tournaments} and the solution we used can be found in~\cite{cygan-2015}

\subsection{A FPT Solution of Odd Cycle Transversal}\label{subsec:fpt-solution-oct}

As we described at \ref{sec:oct}, $X$ is an odd cycle transversal of $G$ if the graph $G-X$ is bipartite.
In order to use the steps declared on \ref{subsec:the-iterative-compression-technique} we must define Disjoint-Odd Cycle Transversal.

The input of this problem is $G$ an undirected graph, an odd cycle transversal $W$ of size $k+1$ and a positive integer $k$.
The objective is to find an odd cycle transversal $X \subseteq V(G) \setminus W$ of size at most $k$ or to conclude that $X$ does not exist.
The presented algorithm gives a solution in time $2^{k}n^{\mathcal{O}(1)}$.

The algorithm For Disjoint-Odd Cycle Transversal will use the following annotated problem as a subroutine.
In the \emph{Annotated Bipartite Coloring} problem, we are given an undirected graph $G$, two sets $B_1,B_2 \subseteq V(G)$ and a positive integer $k$.
The goal is to find a subset $X$ of $V(G)$ with size at most $k$ such that $G-X$ has a coloring $f : V(G) \setminus X \rightarrow {1,2}$ where $f(v) \neq f(u)$ for every edge $(u,v)$
and $f(v) = i$ whenever $v \in B_i \setminus X$, i.e. if a vertex $v$ is originally in $B_1$ the color of it in the result shall be $f(v)=1$.

\textbf{Annotated Bipartite Coloring algorithm.}

Let $(G,B_1,B_2,k)$ be an instance of Annotated Bipartite Coloring.
We can view the vertices of $B_1$ and $B_2$ as precolored vertices from a function $l$, i.e. if $v \in B_i$ then $l(v)=i$.
Is important to notice that $B_1$ adn $B_2$ are not disjoint, meaning any vertex can have both colors, also, $l$ does not necessarily provide a proper coloring,
allowing the coloring $l(v)=l(u)$ for an edge $(v,u)$.

We want to find a set $X$ of size at most $k$ such that in graph $G-X$ there is a proper 2-coloring $f$ extending precolored vertices.
To find such coloring we proceed as follows.

Fix an arbitrary \emph{proper} 2-coloring $f$ of $G$ issuing the $B_1^*,B_2^*$ partitions, such coloring exists as $G$ is bipartite.
Let $C$ be the following set $C := (B_1 \cap B_2^*) \cup (B_2 \cap B_1^*)$, every vertex in $C$ should either be included in $X$ or have "changed" colors,
and similarly each vertex in $R := (B_1 \cap B_1^*) \cup (B_2 \cap B_2^*)$ have retained its color or is a vertex in $X$.

The following lemma helps us solve the annotated problem.

\begin{lemma}\label{lemma:annotated-bipartite-coloring}
  Let $G$ be a bipartite graph and $f$ an arbitrary proper coloring of $G$.
  Then set $X$ is a solution to the Annotated Bipartite Coloring problem if and only if $X$ separates $C$ and $R$.
  Furthermore, provided that such $X$ of size $k$ exists it can be found in time \O{k(n*m)}.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  In a proper 2-coloring $f$ of $G-X$, each vertex of $V(G) \setminus X$ either keeps the same color ($f(v)=l(v)$) or changes it colors ($f(v) \neq l(v)$).
  Moreover, every vertex in a connected component of $G$ must make the same decision in order to maintain the proper coloration, i.e. for every edge $(u,v)$ if $v$ changed then $u$ has to change.
  Therefore, no connected component of $G \setminus X$ may contain a vertex from both $R$ and $C$.
  Consequently, $X$ has to be a separating set of $R$ and $C$.

  Let $X$ be a set separating $R$ and $C$, and $f$ an
